In this project I will implement a higher-order k-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm takes as inputs a list of two-dimensional points, and partitions them into k clusters. Each cluster has a central point, called a center. A center does not have to be one of the input points. A successful clustering must obey two properties:

Each center is the average (mean) of the points in it's cluster.
Each point is in the cluster of the nearest center.
